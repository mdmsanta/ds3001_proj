# Project Overview & The Data Set

For this project, we chose to use the Dataset of [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/morriswongch/kaggle-datasets). Kaggle is a valuable tool for data scientists, however it can be difficult to navigate especially for beginners. By categorizing the data sets the goal is to help students, hobbyists, and researchers more efficiently find data sets useful to them.

# How to Pick a Quality Data Set
Through the project, we chose to give each dataset a quality score, a point value based on the attributes of the dataset. The higher the point value, the more good qualities a dataset has. 

## Assigning Point Values
The following table shows the different attributes used to give points to a dataset with their corresponding point allocation. 

| Variable      | Value Assigned|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| File Type     | Easier Type, more points (i.e. CSV = +3 points)  |
| Dataset Size  | Bigger size gives more points (0-3 points)  | 
| is Featured | Yes= +1|
|is Super Featured | Yes = +1|
|Competition Count| If the set has been in a competition = +1|
|Description| If the set has a description = +1|
|Category| If the set has a category = +1|
|Vote Button| More upvotes gives more points (0-3 points)|
|License Type| Free license  = +1 |

From these attributes, different point categories were created to determine the different "areas" from where the points were coming. 
| Category | Meaning | Attributes|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Popularity | The usage and interaction with the dataset on Kaggle | isFeatured, isSuperFeatured, Ratio, voteButton|
|Quality|The quality of the dataset itself | File Type, Dataset Size, Competition Count|
|Information| The avalible information about the dataset| Description, Category, License Type|



### Categorizing the Data

Categorize the data into Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced. From there users can find data sets appropriate for their experience level. 

Here we will have three visuals to reflect these categories.
Users will be able to:
