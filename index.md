## Project Overview & The Data Set

For this project, we chose to use the Dataset of [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/morriswongch/kaggle-datasets). Kaggle is a valuable tool for data scientists, however it can be difficult to navigate especially for beginners. By categorizing the data sets the goal is to help students, hobbyists, and researchers more efficiently find data sets useful to them.

## How to Pick a Quality Data Set

| Variable      | Value Assigned|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| File Type     | Easier Type, more points (i.e. CSV = +3 points  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  | 

### Categorizing the Data

Categorize the data into Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced. From there users can find data sets appropriate for their experience level. 

Here we will have three visuals to reflect these categories.
Users will be able to:
