## The Dataset

For this project, we chose to use the Dataset of [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/morriswongch/kaggle-datasets).

## Who this Benefits

Our goal is to categorize the datasets so that it is easier for users to find what they are looking for. 

### Categorizing the Data

Categorize the data into Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced. From there users can find datasets appropriate for their experience level. 

Here we will have three visuals to reflect these categories.
Users will be able to:
